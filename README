ANSWERS:

1. One general use of user level threads is in an application that uses a 
	server, and requires shared memory between clients. 
	For example, the app Waze. On one hand, it requires quick switch 
	between clients, and on the other hand, the geo information that each 
	client inserts should appear to all clients. 

2. Advantages: 
 	* If one tab fails, it won't shut down the rest of the tabs. 
 	* Sometimes sharing memory is not the desired behaviour. For example, 
 		when opening the same website in two tabs, we wouldn't want the
 		activity in one tab to affect the other.
 	* Lets the the operating system manage the scheduling of the different
 		tabs better, for example, when one tab requires more resources.
 		
	Disadvangatges: 
	* It takes longer to switch between tabs, because of the overhead. 
	* It may require more space than threads which share memory. 
	
3. The "kill" command, which is inserted by the keyboard, is a wrapper 
	around the kill() system call. kill() gets the arguments pid and 
	signal, in this case it sends the shell signal SIGTERM to the 
	process (pid). The process may declare a handler of its own for the
	 signal (for example, to do cleanups), or it may use the default OS one. 

4. Real time is the real world time, and one use for it is a stopwatch
	application. Virtual time is the time in which a certain process 
	executes on the CPU. One use for it is benchmarks (Performance 
	measurments).
